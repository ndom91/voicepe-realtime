"""LAN announce endpoint: a route back to the device for external agents.

The household's agent (OpenClaw) can finish long-running work minutes after
the voice request that started it. This endpoint lets it speak the outcome in
the room: POST /announce {"message": "..."} → the text plays through the
device's TTS announcement lane (the same guarded path timers use, so the
assistant can't hear itself and reply).

Enabled only when BOTH announce_port and announce_token options are set.
Auth is a bearer token; binding is on the host network, so treat the token
as the only lock and keep it long. 503 when no device is connected — the
caller (an agent) can fall back to iMessage.
